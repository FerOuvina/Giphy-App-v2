# Giphy App v2

# This is a Giphy-like Gif Searching App made in ReactJS with the help of [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev)

## In the course of this project I have learned a lot of things, such as:

* The use of JavaScript libraries through npm.
* Start a project using Vite, the original course used create-react-app, but since that method is deprecated I opted for Vite.
* Creating custom hooks as well as services to consume an API with fetch.
* Using Lazy Load to defer the loading of a component's code.
* Using React Suspense with a fallback to show a Loading component until its children is finished loading.
* Implementing Pagination to dinamically show more gifs as well as Infinite Scroll.
* Using useCallback to cache a function and prevent it from being created again on re-render.
* Using useState, useEffect, useRef.
* Using useContext to share a global context throughout the app.
* Using useReducer to reduce the complexity of the logic from a component.
* Using React.memo to improve the app performance preventing components from re-rendering when its props don't change.
* Implementing SEO React Helmet and Deploy Integrated with GitHub Pages.
* Using CSS in JS and Styled Components with Emotion.
